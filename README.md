# Configuration-Compare-Tool
This tool provides a simple way to compare Room OS configuration files and display any differences.

You will require two codec configuration.txt files generated from the device's local web interface. The configuration file is part of the backup and recovery tools.

Once you have both configuration.txt files, simply upload them via their respective file upload buttons and click "Compare". The tool will show you all values that are different between each configuration.
